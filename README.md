## Hi there 👋

I'm Andreas Abrahamsen, currently studying Front-End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

Background 🎓
Prior to diving into the world of web development, I've had a diverse background. I've served as a youth pastor, educator, and even worked as a bodyguard.

Skills 💻
I'm proficient in using Figma for design, and I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Projects 🚀
1. Rainy Days
A website created as part of my HTML & CSS course. It's a simple e-commerce platform selling high-quality jackets for rainy weather.

2. Discovery Labs
This project was part of my semester at Noroff. It's an interactive website aimed at inspiring curiosity in science and technology.

3. Peaks & Powder
My final project for the spring 2024 semester. It's an immersive website dedicated to exploring the beauty and thrill of mountain sports and skiing.

Interests ❤️
Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, staying active through training and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, being involved in my local church community, and indulging in my love for music and films.
