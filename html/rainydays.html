            I look back on this project with a smile because it was so much fun
            to finally start coding. At the same time, I can't help but laugh a
            little at myself. It's like looking at a drawing you did in
            elementary school—back when you thought you were really good, only
            to realize now how much you'd do differently. But that’s the charm
            of it; everything has a beginning, and this is mine. Rainy Days is a
            website I created as part of my HTML & CSS course in the front-end
            development program at Noroff School of Technology and Digital
            Media. The site is designed to sell high-quality outdoor jackets for
            those who love adventures in the rain. This project was my very
            first foray into web development using HTML and CSS, and it was an
            exciting and invaluable learning experience. Even though I would
            approach many things differently now, Rainy Days stands as a
            testament to my journey's start. It reminds me of the joy and
            challenges of those early days, and I’m proud of how far I've come
            since then.
