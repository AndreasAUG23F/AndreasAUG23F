                I am relatively new to the field of web development, having
                recently transitioned from a background in the security industry
                and customer relations. However, my enthusiasm for UX/UI design
                and front-end development drives me to continuously learn and
                grow in this dynamic field. My previous experience has honed my

                making me a skilled human-centered designer.

              <p>
                With a strong foundation in both web development and graphic

                like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as design tools such as
                Adobe Creative Suite and Figma. My journey may be just
                beginning, but my dedication to creating engaging user
                experiences is unwavering.
