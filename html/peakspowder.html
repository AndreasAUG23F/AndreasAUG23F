            Reflecting on my final project, "Peaks & Powder," from the spring
            2024 semester, I'm reminded of the challenges and growth it brought.
            This project was a significant milestone for me as it was my first
            venture into using JavaScript, adding an extra layer of complexity
            to my development skills. "Peaks & Powder" is an immersive website
            dedicated to exploring and celebrating the beauty and thrill of
            mountain sports and skiing. The site offers dynamic features, such
            as interactive maps, weather forecasts, and user-generated content,
            providing an engaging experience for outdoor enthusiasts. Creating
            "Peaks & Powder" was both daunting and exhilarating. It pushed me to
            expand my programming knowledge and problem-solving abilities,
            especially when incorporating JavaScript functionalities. Despite
            the hurdles faced along the way, seeing the project come to life was
            incredibly rewarding. Looking back, I'm proud of the progress I made
            during this project and the foundation it laid for my continued
            growth as a front-end developer. "Peaks & Powder" serves as a
            reminder of the dedication and passion I have for creating engaging
            and user-centric web experiences.
