            Reflecting on this project brings back a mix of excitement and
            amusement. Discovery Labs was my semester project at Noroff and
            marked an important step in my journey as a front-end developer. It
            wasn't just about writing code; it was about creating something that
            could engage and educate. Discovery Labs is a website designed to
            inspire curiosity and learning in science and technology. It serves
            as an interactive platform where users can explore various
            scientific experiments and technological innovations. This project
            was a step up from my first project, Rainy Days, and it challenged
            me to apply more advanced concepts and skills. Creating Discovery
            Labs was both intense and rewarding. It felt like building a more
            complex piece, where each line of code added a new layer of
            functionality. Looking back, I can see how much I've learned since
            my first project. There are still things I would refine and improve,
            but this project showcases my progress and growing passion for web
            development and UX/UI design. Feel free to get in touch if you have
            any questions or feedback about Discovery Labs. I'm always open to
            new ideas and opportunities to learn and grow. Click one of the
